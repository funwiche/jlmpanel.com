    <h4>Construction</h4>
    <section>
      <p>
        Specially manufactured in minimum quantity of 5 per item, Cherry Triply
        three-layer panels are constructed from 5mm thick, full-length cherry
        faces bonded either side of a cross-banded 10mm or 16mm finger jointed
        core of the same species.
      </p>
      <p>The faces are made from strips of random width of 50-140mm wide.</p>
      <p>
        The cherry strips making up the panel core and faces are bonded together
        with formaldehyde-free D3 water resistant glue, and the faces calibrated
        to 80 grit before being protected with shrinkwrapping
      </p>
      <p>
        The panels can be supplied as produced, or cut or machined to pattern.
        They can also be supplied prefinished with lacquer, oil, wax or special
        finishes as required.

    <h4>Design, storage & processing</h4>
    <section>
      <ul class="list-2col-headed">
        <li>
          Design & storage:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Although these panels are more stable than solid lumber, it is
              vital that design of any installation allows for the risk of
              movement due to changes in ambient moisture or long-term forces
              acting upon the panel
            </li>
            <li>
              The panels should remain within their protective film until ready
              for conversion into their finished sizes
            </li>
            <li>
              Immediately upon receipt, the panels must be stacked directly on
              top of each other and fully supported on perfectly flat, uniform
              supports - the top panel should be fully covered with chipboard or
              MDF, and all edges left allowed to receive good air circulation.
              This can be done with the help of lining strips/slats
            </li>
            <li>
              The panels must then be covered carefully to ensure temperatures
              and air humidity are maintained from receipt of the panels right
              up until further processing
            </li>
            <li>
              Air humidity should remain between 28%-58% and a temperature range
              of 17-24°C in order to maintain flatness. (Higher air humidity
              will lead the panels to take up moisture and swell, while lower
              air humidity will cause them to give up their inner cell moisture
              and shrink)
            </li>
            <li>
              NB: Extremes outside the above ranges risk damage to the panels,
              so it is vital to ventilate the storage to ensure the conditions
              needed.
            </li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Processing:
          <ul>
            <li>
              After cutting the panels to their final dimension and before final
              processing, it is strongly recommended that the panels are left to
              acclimatise for a few days with the panels stacked directly one on
              another (still in their clear film if possible) and the top panel
              of the stack be covered with chipboard, MDF or similar lower
              humidity product.
            </li>
            <li>
              If one or more of the above cannot be followed it is safest to
              keep the panels as supplied, with the film intact, and stored
              carefully on a horizontal surface covered in full length and
              stacked one panel directly on another and a sheet of chipboard or
              similar panel with lower humidity used as a cover sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should keep them stored this way until actually processing
              them further.
            </li>
            <li>
              Important: To minimize the chance of deflection, panels should
              always be processed simultaneously on both sides (sanding,
              brushing, profiling, lacquering / oiling) and the thickness of the
              outer layers remain balanced on both sides of the core after
              processing
            </li>
